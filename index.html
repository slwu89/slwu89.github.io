    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
    
    Sean obtained his B.A. from UC Irvine where he studied International Relations & Statistics, and his MPH from UC Berkeley in Epidemiology & Biostatistics. 
    He is currently pursuing his PhD in Epidemiology with a designated emphasis in Computational Biology under  <a href="https://www.marshalllab.com">Dr. John M. Marshall</a>. 
    He is interested in the investigation of stochastic processes through analytic and numerical methods to help infectious disease epidemiologists better understand and describe disease transmission systems. 
    Other areas of interest are probabilistic risk communication and graphical models.
    More distant areas of interest he really has no right to talk about due to sheer ignorance are the interface between logical and statistical inference, complex systems (broadly, how to even <i>define it</i>; he attended the Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School and found the kool-aid much to his liking), variance reduction for Monte Carlo simulation, and the history of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan.
    He simultaneously likes and hates programming, and purely likes cooking, archery, hiking, and drawing. His Google scholar profile is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LovpXkAAAAAJ">here</a>.
